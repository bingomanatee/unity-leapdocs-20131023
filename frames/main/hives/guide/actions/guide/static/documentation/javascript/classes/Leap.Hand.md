The Hand class reports the physical characteristics of a detected hand.
Hands are accessed as properties of the Leap.Frame's hand array; at this point, up to two hands can be simultaneously tracked and returned with frame data.
Hand tracking data includes a palm position and velocity; vectors for the palm normal and direction to the fingers;
properties of a sphere fit to the hand; and lists of the attached fingers and tools.

See the Leap.Frame class documentation for the difference between Pointables, Fingers and Tools.
